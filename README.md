# Custom-Confusion-Matrix-in-R
The confusion matrix is used in order to summarise the prediction results on a classification problem. 
Accuracy: Overall, how often is the classifier correct?
Precision: When it predicts yes, how often is it correct?
Sensitivity: When it's actually yes, how often does it predict yes?
Specificity : When it's actually no, how often does it predict no?
